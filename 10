Overview of operating systems: history, functionality, design issues.
Operating system principles: structures, abstractions, and APIs.
Concurrency: process state, context switches, mutual exclusion, semaphores,
deadlock. Scheduling: preemption, schedulers, processes and threads.
Memory management: swapping, paging, segmentation, placement and
replacement policies. File systems. User interface. Distributed algorithms:
consensus, termination, fault tolerance.
