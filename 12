Design, implementation, and manipulation of complex abstract data types,
including trees and graphs. Fundamental algorithms: advanced sorting,
depth- and breadth-first traversals, string manipulation, pattern matching,
and graph algorithms. Algorithmic strategies: brute-force, greedy,
divide-and-conquer, backtracking, branch-and-bound, dynamic programming,
randomized, parallel, and distributed. Introduction to algorithm analysis
and complexity theory.
